├── Organization Owner (Level 9)
    ├── Agent Administrator (Level 8)
        ├── Agent Developer (Level 7)
        ├── Business Analyst (Level 6)

```

### Permission Inheritance
- Higher-level roles inherit all permissions from lower levels
- Specific permissions can be granted/revoked at any level
- Organization boundaries are strictly enforced
- Cross-organization access only for Platform Admins

### Security Considerations
- Multi-factor authentication required for Admin and Owner roles
- Session management with automatic timeout
- Audit logging for all administrative actions
- IP-based access restrictions for sensitive operations
- Regular permission reviews and access certification

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Core RBAC (Month 1)
- Implement basic user registration and authentication
- Create role assignment system
- Build permission checking middleware
- Implement organization isolation

### Phase 2: Advanced Permissions (Month 2)
- Fine-grained permissions for specific features
- Temporary access and delegation capabilities
- API key management with scoped permissions
- Advanced audit logging

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features (Month 3)
- SSO integration (SAML, OAuth)
- Advanced user management (bulk operations)
- Compliance reporting and access reviews
- Custom role creation capabilities

This user management framework provides clear role definitions while maintaining security and scalability for the AgentHub platform's growth from startup to enterprise scale.
